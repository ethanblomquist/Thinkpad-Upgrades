<h1>Rebuilding and Upgrading a Thinkpad T480 Laptop</h1>
<p>
I started this project because I needed an affordable laptop for study, work, and projects. The Thinkpad series of laptops has a stellar reputation for durability, serviceability and performance. Let's rebuild a laptop together from the ground up!

<h2>Goals for this Project</h2>
<p>
Ultimately I want a solid laptop with good battery life, enough performace for smooth web browsing and office productivity(Word, Excel etc.) I also need the machine to perform IT related tasks such as local virtualization, scripting/programming and other basic Windows/Linux functions such as BASH, Powershell, RDP etc.
</p>
<h3>Additionally we will need to:</h3>

  - Install missing hardware into used laptop
  - Dual boot Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10 on the same hard drive
  - Keep costs to a minimum

<h2>Barebones T480 Specs</h2>

As you can see below there isn't much included in this used T480 I found on ebay. However, the price was relatively low and it gives us a chance to rebuild the system to our own specifications.
