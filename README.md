<h1>Rebuilding and Upgrading a Thinkpad T480 Laptop</h1>
<p>
I started this project because I needed an affordable laptop for study, work, and projects. The Thinkpad series of laptops has a stellar reputation for durability, serviceability and performance. Let's rebuild a laptop together from the ground up!

<h2>Goals for this Project</h2>
<p>
Ultimately I want a solid laptop with good battery life, enough performace for smooth web browsing and office productivity(Word, Excel etc.) I also need the machine to perform IT related tasks such as local virtualization, scripting/programming and other basic Windows/Linux functions such as BASH, Powershell, RDP etc.
</p>
<h3>Additionally we will need to:</h3>

  - Install missing hardware into used laptop
  - Dual boot Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10 on the same hard drive
  - Keep costs to a minimum

<h2>Barebones T480 Specs</h2>
<p>
As you can see below there isn't much included in this used T480 I found on ebay. However, the price was relatively low and it gives us a chance to rebuild the system to our own specifications.

<h2>Part 1: Hardware Installation</h2>

<h3>Step 1:Cleaning the Laptop</h3>
<p>
This laptop came to me pretty dirty, first thing I'd like to do is clean it thoroughly. I removed the stickers and sticker residue, then cleaned and polished all the surfaces, as well as anything stuck in the vents.

When installing SODIMM, be sure to line up the indentation, push in slightly, then push down until the RAM locks into place.

<h3>Step 5: Remove and Install the Internal Battery</h3>
<p>
There are two small screws holding the internal battery into place. After removing them, unplug the small connector near the CPU fan. The installation is the reverse process. I used a pair of forceps to push in the connector.

<h3>Step 1: Windows 10 Installation</h3>
<p>
We need a portable storage device to install our operating systems. I had a 32gb SD card laying around, so I decided to use that. We will start with Windows 10. On my other laptop that has an SD card reader, I downloaded the Windows Media Creation Tool. Run the program -> Accept -> Create installation media -> Next -> 64-bit Windows 10 -> USB Flash Drive -> Select the drive for the removable storage (D:) -> Next -> The program may take a significant amount of time to run
